# Abstract

Background. 窶ジest Nile virus (WNV) infection in humans can result in severe,
acute encephalitis typically involving subcortical gray matter brain regions.
West Nile virus replication within specific human brain regions from a human case
of acute encephalitis has not been studied. 

Methods. 窶ジe describe a fatal case of WNV encephalitis in which we obtained 
tissue from specific brain regions at autopsy to evaluate viral-host interactions 
using next-generation sequencing and immunohistochemistry analysis. 

Results. 窶ジe found that WNV populations in the injured subcortical brain regions 
exhibited increased amino acid variation and increased expression of specific 
interferon genes compared with cortical tissues despite similar viral burden. 

Conclusions. 窶サhese observational, patient-based data suggest that neuronal 
injury and the strength of viral selection pressure may be associated with the 
level of the innate immune responses. Further studies in human and animal models 
evaluating the role of innate immune responses on injury patterns and viral selection 
pressure are needed.
