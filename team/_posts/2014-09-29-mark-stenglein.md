I'm an Assistant Professor in the Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology [department](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/Pages/default.aspx) at Colorado State University.  My research aims to apply a variety of old and new techniques to better understand viruses.  I am motivated to do this because viruses can (sometimes) cause disease but also because I find them endlessly fascinating.
