## Origin

This website is based on that of [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who has created a powerful site generation and project collaboration framework that he has made [freely available for download](https://github.com/blab/blotter).  

## Logo

![virus-like logo](/images/logo.svg)

The logo combines elements of two of our research interests: viruses and data visualization.  The logo is a [chord diagram](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062006) created using [d3](http://d3js.org/), a powerful interactive data visualization tool.  The shape of the diagram evokes a [virus particle](http://www.virology.ws/2009/03/06/virus-images-at-viperdb/).
