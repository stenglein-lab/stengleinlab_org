We are always looking for curiosity-driven and dedicated scientists to join our group. 

Our research interests include viruses, viral diseases, viral evolution, genomics, computational biology, and data visualization

## Undergraduate research experiences

Freshman, sophomore or junior students typically start in the lab as volunteers. After a 2-3 month period in this capacity, opportunities are generally available for directed research, or paid part-time research. Interested students are encouraged to get in touch (mark.stenglein<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@colostate.edu). MIP undergraduates should consider participating in the MIP [Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/research/Pages/Undergraduate-Research-Opportunities.aspx).

## Graduate students

Graduate students in the [MIP](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/graduate/Pages/default.aspx) and [CMB](http://www.cmb.colostate.edu/) graduate programs can join the group. Interested students should get in touch (mark.stenglein<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@colostate.edu). Rotation students are welcome.

## Postdoctoral researchers 

We'd be happy to talk to potential postdocs about working in our lab.  Please send a cover letter that includes the names and contacts for three references and a short statement of research interests, and a current CV to mark.stenglein<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@colostate.edu

## DVM students and post-DVM Residents

Researchers with a clinical perspective are very welcome in the lab.  

- DVM students typically work in the lab under the auspices of the [Veterinary Summary Scholars Program](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/dvm-program/Pages/Veterinary-Scholars-Program.aspx).  Note that the application deadline is usually in February.  
- DVMs in the MIP [residency programs](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/residency/Pages/default.aspx) are most welcome to inquire about PhD training opportunities.  

## Technical Positions

These will be advertised periodically through the CSU [Jobs site](http://www.colostate.edu/jobs.aspx)
