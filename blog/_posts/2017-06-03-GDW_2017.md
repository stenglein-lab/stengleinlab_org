I'm delighted to be participating in the inaugural [Genomics of Disease in Wildlife Workshop](http://gdwworkshop.colostate.edu/), which is being held starting today at Colorado State University.  We just had our kick off reception, and I'm very impressed by the other instructors and the workshop participants.  It seems like a great group.

I'm going to be leading several of the sections, on genomics, sequencing, accessing online resources, de novo assembly, and metagenomics.  

I'm putting all of the material (lectures, exercises) I've developed for this workshop up on GitHub, [here](http://github.com/stenglein-lab/2017_GDW/).
