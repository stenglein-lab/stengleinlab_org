title: Lab hike in lieu of lab meeting

It's been warm and sunny and last week we went on the first of many 'lab hikes in lieu of lab meetings'.  We hiked up Arthur's rock in [Lory State Park](http://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/Lory). It was great to spend the morning outside!  

Our lab is in the Infectious Disease Research Complex at CSU's Foothills campus, which, as you might guess, abuts the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.  Lory State Park is just a mile or two west of our building, on the other side of Horsetooth Reservoir.
