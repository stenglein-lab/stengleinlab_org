title: New paper on mosquito viruses out
author: Mark Stenglein
---

Our [paper]({% post_url papers/2016-07-31-Fauver-anopheles_viruses %}) on viruses in wild _Anopheles gambiae_ mosquitoes was recently published in Virology and is one of several articles higlighted in its [issue](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00426822/498).  We had the opportunity to write a [blog post](http://www.virologyhighlights.com/sequences-characterized-of-new-viruses-that-infect-anopheles-gambiae/) on Virology Highlights Blog , (motto: 'Chosen by editors / Written by researchers').  It was fun to write about the paper in a less formal than usual context and to explain some of the back story and challenges we faced..

There are several additional reasons that I am happy about the publication of this paper.  First, it's my first 'last author' paper, which, I guess, means I'm in charge!?!  Second, it is a product of our lab's growing connections with the other labs in the [AIDL](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/aidl/Pages/default.aspx).  I am truly excited about the opportunity to be part of this fantastic group and it was great to work with the Ebel, Foy, and Brackney labs here.  Finally, this publication spawned some exciting follow-up projects that we are pursuing.  Keep tuned for developments on that front.
