[Shaun]({% post_url team/2016-08-16-shaun-cross %}) has been selected to participate in the [GAUSSI program](http://gaussi.colostate.edu/).  Congratulations, Shaun!

The GAUSSI program at CSU is an NSF-funded program that aims to teach biologists more computing and computer scientists more biology. It offers 1-year fellowships to PhD students and a series of modular 1 and 2 credit [courses](http://gaussi.colostate.edu/curriculum/fallcourses/) that allow trainees to pursue a tailored curriculum.

I co-teach a class in the GAUSSI program (with [Carol Wilusz](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/Pages/Carol-Wilusz.aspx) and [Dan Sloan](http://www.biology.colostate.edu/people/dbsloan/)), that teaches students how to design and perform experiments using next generation sequencing.
