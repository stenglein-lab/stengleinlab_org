Today is [Joey's]({% post_url team/2015-05-11-joseph-allison %}) last day in the lab.  He's starting as a bioinformatician at [Somalogic](http://somalogic.com) in Boulder, CO.

This is the first time a lab member has left the lab, and it's bittersweet.  I know that one of my jobs as a PI is to train postdocs and help them to get jobs, so in a sense this is exactly as it should be. But we are sad to see Joey go, and wish him well!
