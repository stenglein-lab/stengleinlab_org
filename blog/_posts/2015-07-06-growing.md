The lab is growing!  Since starting last fall, I am lucky to have been joined by a number of talented researchers:  


[Joey Allison]({% post_url team/2015-05-11-joseph-allison %}) is a postdoc tackling a variety of computational challenges. 

[Marylee Layton]({% post_url team/2015-05-11-marylee-layton %}) is a recent graduate of the MIP Microbiologyâ€“Immunology Master of Science [grad program](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/graduate/Pages/microbiology-immunology-professional-masters.aspx) 

[Laura Hoon-Hanks]({% post_url team/2015-05-11-laura-hoon-hanks %}) is an anatomic pathology resident in the MIP Residency and PhD [program](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/residency/Pages/anatomic-pathology-residency.aspx)

Undergraduate [Meredith Voyles]({% post_url team/2015-05-11-meredith-voyles %}) is away from Colorado for the summer, but she will be rejoining the lab in the fall.
