## Abstract

Zika virus (ZIKV; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) is a rapidly expanding
global pathogen that has been associated with severe clinical manifestations,
including devastating neurological disease in infants. There are currently no
molecular clones of a New World ZIKV available that lack significant attenuation,
hindering progress toward understanding determinants of transmission and
pathogenesis. Here we report the development and characterization of a novel ZIKV
reverse genetics system based on a 2015 isolate from Puerto Rico (PRVABC59). We
generated a two-plasmid infectious clone system from which infectious virus was
rescued that replicates in human and mosquito cells with growth kinetics
representative of wild-type ZIKV. Infectious clone-derived virus initiated
infection and transmission rates in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes comparable to those 
of the primary isolate and displayed similar pathogenesis in AG129 mice. This
infectious clone system provides a valuable resource to the research community to
explore ZIKV molecular biology, vaccine development, antiviral development,
diagnostics, vector competence, and disease pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE: ZIKV is a
rapidly spreading mosquito-borne pathogen that has been linked to Guillain-Barré 
syndrome in adults and congenital microcephaly in developing fetuses and infants.
ZIKV can also be sexually transmitted. The viral molecular determinants of any of
these phenotypes are not well understood. There is no reverse genetics system
available for the current epidemic virus that will allow researchers to study
ZIKV immunity, develop novel vaccines, or develop antiviral drugs. Here we
provide a novel infectious clone system generated from a recent ZIKV isolated
from a patient infected in Puerto Rico. This infectious clone produces virus with
in vitro and in vivo characteristics similar to those of the primary isolate,
providing a critical tool to study ZIKV infection and disease.

#### Comment

The Stenglein group had a minimal role in this nice paper from the [Ebel lab](http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/aidl/Pages/ebel-greg.aspx) and other groups at CSU and the CDC.
