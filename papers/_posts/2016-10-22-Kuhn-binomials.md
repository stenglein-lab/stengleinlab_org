## Abstract

Botanical, mycological, zoological, and prokaryotic species names follow the
Linnaean format, consisting of an italicized Latinized binomen with a capitalized genus name
and a lower-case species epithet (e.g., *Homo sapiens*). Virus species names, however, do not
follow a uniform format, and even when binomial, are not Linnaean in style. In this thought
exercise, we attempted to convert all currently official names of species included in the virus
family *Arenaviridae* and the virus order *Mononegavirales* to Linnaean binomials, and to identify
and address associated challenges and concerns. Surprisingly, this endeavor was not as
complicated or time-consuming as even the authors of this article expected when conceiving the
experiment.
